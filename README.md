       start_server(&server);

       return 0;
   }
   ```

2. **Create Files:**

   Place the files `index.html` and `about.html` in the same directory as your executable or adjust the paths accordingly.

3. **Accessing the Server:**

   Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the `index.html` file. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/about` to view the `about.html` file.
